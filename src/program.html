<h2>What is Ankylosing Spondylitis?</h2>
<p>Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), also known as Bechterew’s disease is a form of arthritis that primarily affects the joints in the spine. In some people Ankylosing Spondylitis
    can affect the shoulders, ribs, hips, knees and feet. Ankylosing Spondylitis can even affect the eyes. Bechterew’s disease is an autoimmune disease. It attacks the body’s own immune system. In addition to musculoskeletal systems, patients with Bechterew’s disease can also suffer from inflammation of the eye, skin and/or chronic inflammatory intestinal disease.

<h2>How Is a Person Affected? </h2>

<h2>How is Ankylosing Spondylitis Treated?</h2>
<p>
There are treatments that can lessen your symptoms and possibly slow down ankylosing spondylitis progression, but currently there is no cure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the medications doctors most commonly use to treat ankylosing spondylitis. 
If NSAIDs do not relieve pain, your doctor might suggest a biologic medication. Physical therapy can be use to increase range of motion and improve stength.
